## About CareBuddy

## Architecture Design
  <br>
CareBuddy is designed with a microservices architecture, separating the frontend, backend, and data processing components to enhance scalability and maintainability. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, while the frontend leverages React for a dynamic user experience.

Key components include:

- **Frontend**: Built with React to provide a seamless user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and data processing.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes a NoDB design to enable rapid development while retaining the integrity of the application.

## UI/UX Design
  <br>
The UI/UX design focuses on intuitive navigation and accessibility, crafted using Figma for prototyping. The design incorporates principles of simplicity and user-friendliness, inspired by the aesthetics of Big Hero 6 to create an engaging interface.

Key design elements include:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various mobile devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhances user engagement through interactive components and user-centric design.
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintains a cohesive look and feel throughout the application.



## User Manual
  <br>
The user manuals provide step-by-step guides for both users and developers. These manuals cover features such as the chat interface, patient evaluation form, and managing favorites. Access the user manuals [here](#).



## Future Development
  <br>
Our future plans include:

- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Integrating more advanced AI models for personalized health assessments and the adoption of RAG to customize the LLM responses to the user.
- **Enhanced Data Security**: Implementing advanced security measures to protect user data, such as implementing OAUTH.
- **Mobile App Development**: Refactor the code to utilize React Native, Swift, or Flutter to ensure scalable mobile architecture.
